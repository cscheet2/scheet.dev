# About Me

Hello, I'm Cameron! I'm pursuing a Bachelor of Science in Software Engineering at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln. My current interests include data visualization and robotics, but I’m always eager to explore new areas of computing. I’m currently working as a UCARE researcher in the Constraint Systems Laboratory at UNL, where I’m developing a MiniSAT visualization tool to enhance SAT education within the School of Computing. I’m seeking a Software Engineering internship in the Lincoln/Omaha area but am open to out-of-state opportunities for the summer.
